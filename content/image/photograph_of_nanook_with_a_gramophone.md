notes: 'Caption reads: "Nanook and his family loved to listen to opera recordings
  played on the gramophone. According to Flaherty, "Caruso in the Pagliacci prologue
  with its tragic ending was to them the most comic record of the lot. Nanook shook
  with laughter; the children rolled with merriment on the floor."'
