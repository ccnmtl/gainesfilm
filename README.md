gainesfilm on hugo


Dates are special in hugo and a required field for content types, therefore I changed the column title date in the tsv for documents and videos to DateAdded, since I will need to add a date field for document creation/order of documents. I changed the DateColumn of images to DateCreated, will rename to DateAdded and rerun script.
